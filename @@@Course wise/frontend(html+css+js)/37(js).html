<!-- we can write js in head tag as well as just before ending of body -->
<!-- If we write our js before ending of  body then the content of body will be loaded will be loaded first then the script will run.So the DOM will also not get blocked which might happen if we write in head-->

<!-- we can also link js script -->
<!-- JS is dynamic language -->
<!-- It is very  forgiving language as if we dont give ;
it will not throw errors

Moreover if we dont initialize our variable with let/const/var no error will come as it is a forgiving language-->
