        In today's tutorial, we will study about the primitive and reference datatype and their differences. In JavaScript, a variable stores two types of values:<strong> primitive and reference</strong>. JavaScript provides six primitive types like Boolean, number, string, undefined, null, symbol, and a reference type as object literals, array, functions, and dates. When we assign a value to a variable, the JavaScript engine will determine whether the value belongs to primitive or reference datatype. We do not have to specify the type of data that whether it is a string or an integer.

    <h1>Primitive types:-</h1>
    <p>
        Primitive data types are numbers, Booleans, strings, undefined, null, and symbol. Primitive data types are the basic or common data types in JavaScript. Following is the table of primitive data types in JavaScript.

    <h1>
        Reference Types
    </h1>
    <p>
        Reference in JavaScript are datatypes based on primitive. Like Objects, Arrays, and Functions. Everything is JavaScript is either an Object or Primitive datatype. When we create an object, that value is not directly assigned to the variable. Instead, a reference to that value is what gets set. Variable knows about the location of the object in memory, not the object itself. Following is the table of the reference data type.

        <h3>What is the difference between primitive and reference datatype?</h3>
JavaScript stores the primitive value on the stack because the size of a primitive value is fixed. On the other hand, JavaScript stores the reference value on the heap because the size of the reference value is dynamic.
One of the most significant differences between primitive data and reference data is that, If the value is primitive, then we manipulate the actual valuestored in that variable. Whereas, If the value is of reference data type, we can manipulate that object's reference, rather than the actual object. It means a variable that stores an object is accessed by reference.
